This is a simple rsync backup script, very much inspired by rsnapshot,
but with very few dependencies (just a bash and rsync) and backups are pushed
to a server rather than pulled in.
Incremental snapshots are rotated in hourly, daily, weekly and monthly intervals.

To use, put the backup script in ~/bin

At startup the backup script reads a config directory (default:
$HOME/.backup), with a layout like this:

.backup
├── config
├── module1
│   ├── config
│   └── exclude
└── module2
    ├── config
    └── exclude

The top-level config file contains global settings.  Most configuration
goes in here.

Each module's config file contains settings specific to that module.
Usually this is just the local path to back up.

Each module's exclude file is passed to rsync, and can cause some local
paths to not be backed up.

I run this with the following crontab entries:
@reboot $HOME/bin/backup > $HOME/.backup/log 2>&1
49 * * * * $HOME/bin/backup > $HOME/.backup/log 2>&1

On the backup server, the backups are found in the directory named by the
'remote_path' config variable.  remote_path will have one subdirectory
per configured module, containing the backups of that module.

Each module's backups will look something like this:
